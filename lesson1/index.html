    Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[40] is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of
    Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy, and often ignorant to the
    world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he
    cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.
    His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade
    racer, playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride
    the Champion Mechanical Horse".
    Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is
    often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his
    friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak.

    Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
    discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
    "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
